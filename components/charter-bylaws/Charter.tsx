            <strong>ARTICLE I</strong> - <strong>VISION</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The vision of the Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation (the “
            <strong>Foundation</strong>”) is to create and nurture a community
            of individuals and organizations that are committed to ensuring the
            longevity, stewardship, and innovation of enterprise grade/class
            open source software that is always freely available.

            <strong>PRINCIPLES OF THE FOUNDATION</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            These principles serve as the fundamental, immutable, truths that
            guide the decisions and goals of the Foundation. No action(s) may be
            taken by the Foundation that is contrary to the following principles
            which is both enforced and made transparent by the Foundation
            Bylaws:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Community Responsibility</strong>. The Foundation is
                here for the benefit of the public community. We are a self
                imposed not-for-profit organization[^1] and thus we will never
                be driven, motivated, or manipulated by profit or monetary gain.
                The Foundation is structured and governed via systems of checks
                and balances (as set forth in the Foundation Bylaws) ensuring
                that no single entity, organization, corporation, association,
                or individual is permitted to have a single controlling
                influence over any assets, the Foundation as a whole, or its
                Projects. Additionally, the community is to be represented, by
                the community for the community, with no “pay to play” for
                control; board and leadership seats are never bought, they are
                earned.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Free, Open Source, and Reproducible</strong>. Everything
                we do is intended to be freely available and open source and
                will leverage only OSI approved permissive, non-copyleft
                open-source licenses for our Projects. All of our build tools,
                dependencies, and SBOMs will always be available so others can
                completely reproduce all release artifacts. Projects will be
                encouraged to avoid dependencies on copyleft libraries, and to
                be transparent about possible license conflicts with permissive
                licenses for Projects.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Projects</strong>. The Foundation will build, host, and
                “adopt” open source Projects which are of value to the
                enterprise community and/or other Foundation projects. Each
                project will abide by these principles and strive for longevity,
                reproducibility, and community collaboration as well as the
                betterment of the project, community, and ecosystem. Projects
                will avoid end-of-life for support except with ample advance
                notice. If a project must cease maintenance or leave the
                Foundation, the Foundation will endeavor to move the project,
                including its trademark rights, to a successor.

            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Transparency</strong>. The Foundation will remain
                transparent to the community as defined by our bylaws and bound
                by our data security policy. This means all development
                processes, discussions, and critical communication, to the
                fullest extent possible, will always be done in the open with
                nothing held back from the community or sold for fees.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Growth and Equality of Opportunity</strong>: The
                Foundation strives to build and maintain a collaborative and
                respectful environment that provides equal access to
                opportunities and resources for everyone within the community.
                This charter defines a merit-based process so that anybody can
                become a contributor, committer, or leader within the Foundation
                or any of the Foundation projects. Growth and inclusiveness of
                all individuals and organizations is imperative for the
                long-term stability and success of the Foundation’s vision. The
                Foundation will encourage Projects to develop robust
                documentation, promote maximum inclusion, and encourage the
                admission and contributions of non-technical Members.
