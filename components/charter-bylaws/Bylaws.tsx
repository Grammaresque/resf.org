              special meeting of the committee. A special meeting must be called

              majority of the Directors present at a meeting at which a quorum
              is present shall be the act of the Board. If less than a quorum is
              present at a meeting, a majority of the Directors present may
              adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice other
              than an announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be
              present. No Officer or Director may vote or act by proxy at any

              who may act by proxy through the applicable Project Board Vice

              of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in

              replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the
              committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member at any

              any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such
              member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint
              another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of

              extent provided in the resolution of the Board, shall have and may
              exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the
              management of the business and affairs of the Foundation with
              respect to the matters delegated to the committee, but no
              committee shall have the power or authority in reference to
              adopting, amending or repealing these Bylaws, or any other matter
              which has not been expressly delegated to the committee. Each such
              committee shall keep minutes and make such reports as the Board
              may from time to time request. Except as the Foundation Board may
              otherwise determine, any committee may make rules for the conduct
              of its business, but unless otherwise provided by the directors or
              in such rules, its business shall be conducted as nearly as
              possible in the same manner as is provided in these Bylaws for the
              Board, including the quorum rules. Except as otherwise provided in
              these Bylaws, or the resolution of the Board designating the
              committee, a committee may create one or more subcommittees, each
              subcommittee to consist of one or more members of the committee,
              and delegate to a subcommittee any or all of the powers and
              authority of the committee.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Nomination Committee</strong>. The Board will have a
              Nomination Committee made up of Foundation Directors appointed by
              the Board. The Nomination Committee is tasked with developing
              procedures for nominating Foundation Directors, receiving
              nominations for Foundation Directors, and organizing the elections
              at the annual meeting of the Members.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advisory Boards; Community Input</strong>. The Board may
              create one or more advisory boards (each, an “
              <strong>Advisory Board</strong>”) who will advise the Board on
              various aspects related to the activities of the Foundation.
              Members of an Advisory Board do not need to be Members of the
              Foundation. An Advisory Board may bring matters to the Foundation
              Board for a vote without the need for a second for matters
              relating to the purpose of the specific Advisory Board. The Board
              may also seek community input via DAOs or other distributed means
              of decision making. Such input will be advisory only and not be
              binding on the Board or the Foundation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compensation</strong>. Directors will not receive
              compensation for their services as Directors. However, Directors
              who provide services to the Foundation in capacities other than as
              Directors may be compensated for such other roles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Restrictions on Related Parties</strong>. No meeting of
              the Board will allow a quorum to be established or maintained if
              more than one third of the Board are employed by, consulting for,
              or have a substantial financial interest (5% ownership or more) in
              the same company, organization, or corporate structure. If a
              quorum cannot be established as a result of this restriction, the
              Directors in question will be required to select a Director or
              Directors to abstain from Board activities (voting, movements,
              seconds, etc.), but may still remain in attendance, for the
              remainder of the meeting. The abstaining member(s) will not count
              towards establishing or maintaining a quorum in any way. If, for
              whatever reason, a quorum still cannot be established or
              maintained, all members in question will be required to abstain
              from board activities (voting, movements, seconds, etc.), but may
              remain in attendance, for the remainder of the meeting.

              <strong>Confidentiality</strong>. Members of the Foundation Board

              Foundation Board and Project Boards and other matters relating to
              the activities of the Foundation Board and Project Boards.
              Further, Members of the Foundation Board and Project Board will
              not disclose information that is designated confidential by the
              Foundation Board.

                . The Foundation will indemnify and hold harmless, to the
                fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently
                exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (an “
                <strong>Indemnified Person</strong>”) who was or is made or is
                threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any
                action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
                administrative or investigative (a “<strong>Proceeding</strong>
                ”), by reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom
                such person is the legal representative, is or was a director or
                officer of the Foundation or, while a director or officer of the
                Foundation, is or was serving at the request of the Foundation
                as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation
                or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
                trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, against all liability and
                loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys’ fees)
                reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in such
                Proceeding. The Foundation shall be required to indemnify an
                Indemnified Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part
                thereof) commenced by such Indemnified Person only if the
                commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the
                Indemnified Person was authorized in advance by the Board.

                final disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent
                required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the
                final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon
                receipt of an undertaking by the Indemnified Person to repay all
                amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the
                Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this
                Article VI or otherwise.

                Article VI is not paid in full within 30 days after a written
                claim therefor by the Indemnified Person has been received by
                the Foundation, the Indemnified Person may file suit to recover
                the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or
                in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting
                such claim. In any such action the Foundation shall have the
                burden of proving that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to
