    question: "Why does the Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation (RESF) exist?",
    answer: `<p>What we've created with the RESF is an organizational body designed to help open source projects thrive with a structure that ensures a balanced and fair distribution of community control while specifically enabling enterprise use-cases, vendors, and commercial entities. Our charter and bylaws set forth an inclusive management framework, commitment, and accountability to ensure the longevity and success of our hosted open source projects and their respective communities.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Our vision is to create and nurture a community of individuals and organizations that are committed to ensuring the longevity, stewardship, and innovation of enterprise grade/class open source software that is always freely available.</p>
    <br />    
    <p>We invite all individuals and organizations who believe in this vision to stand with us and be part of this Foundation and Projects.</p>`,

  {
    slug: "preventing-centos",
    question:
      "How will this organizational structure and accompanying bylaws prevent what happened with CentOS from happening again with the RESF and Rocky Linux?",
    answer: `<p>First, to mention the obvious, CentOS Linux has been amazing to millions of people and organizations around the world, and we strive to be as purposeful to the world as CentOS has been. Many of our goals are modeled exactly from what made CentOS so amazing, but that doesn’t mean that some things couldn’t be improved, and that is where we really focused…</p>
    <br />
    <p>We are ensuring the long term success of Rocky Linux and the RESF by guaranteeing:</p>
    <br />
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-7">
    <li class="pl-2 pb-1"><span class="font-bold">Accountability</span>: State what we are going to do and be accountable for doing it</li>
    <li class="pl-2 py-1"><span class="font-bold">Community</span>: The organizational structure is built around checks and balances always ensuring the community’s benefit</li>
    <li class="pl-2 py-1"><span class="font-bold">Corporate</span> Balance: Absolute transparency including checks and balances between community and corporations</li>
    <li class="pl-2 py-1"><span class="font-bold">Inclusion</span>: Make sure that everyone who wants to be involved, can be involved</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pt-1"><span class="font-bold">Growth</span>: Projects with many members and voices tend to be more stable and longer lasting</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <p>In short, under our bylaws, it is impossible for any single company or individual (including Kurtzer) to hijack or hold any of the RESF Project(s) hostage. But this is only one facet of what these bylaws do and we believe that now the RESF and all hosted Projects provide what individuals, organizations, and enterprises need to rely on for decades to come.</p>`,
